A web-based "To-Do" app is a digital tool designed to help users manage their tasks, projects, and daily responsibilities efficiently. This app serves as an online organizer, enabling individuals and teams to stay on top of their schedules, prioritize their work, and achieve their goals with ease. Whether for personal use or team collaboration, a "To-Do" web app streamlines task management and boosts productivity.

Task Creation and Management: Users can create tasks with just a few clicks, adding details such as due dates, priority levels, and notes. The app should support task categorization, allowing users to organize tasks into lists or projects.

Drag-and-Drop Functionality: To enhance user experience, the app could include drag-and-drop features, enabling users to easily rearrange tasks, move them between lists, or change their priority.
